### SXM2 to PCIE adapter

#### 0.We prioritize the power supply capacity when the GPU is fully loaded. Therefore, we will upgrade the adapter board to **3×8-pin + PCIe power supply**, with a **theoretical rated power of 525W**.  

#### This will make it compatible with **PG199** graphics cards and provide greater reliability for **V100** and **P100**.

#### 1.compatible with V100 and P100 GPU models
#### 2.stable operation on PCIE x16
#### 3.dual 8PIN power supply + PCIE interface power，can provide up to 525W of power
#### 4.uses the imported 84740-102LF interface, stable performance

#### 5.no NVLink, plug-and-play. 

#### This SXM2 to PCIE adapter comes in multiple versions, all of which operate stably. There are two smaller adapters, each measuring 10cm × 10cm, and one larger adapter, measuring 13.3cm × 20cm. One of the larger and one of the smaller adapters support the addition of a microcontroller for temperature reading, allowing fan speed control via PWM. The larger adapter also has pre-drilled holes for custom cooling modifications, such as installing an RTX 4090 heatsink or other cooling solutions.
